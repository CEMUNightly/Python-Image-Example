# Python Image (and Window) Example ✅

Hello, I'm CEMUNightly ;D

I created this "Python-image-example" just for fun, but since some users were interested (especially those less experienced in the language) I decided to release this little code.

Below you will find a small tutorial on how to create your own, export it to .exe, or make it compatible with Windows 7 and 8.

I hope you like it <3
